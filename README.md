# algorithm-visualizer

***NOTE*** : As of December 27, 2024, this project isn't done because I need to implement the searching algorithms and user
changability of the functions.

This is a project that I undertook initially to learn about algorithms and have something to reference back to to see them in action.
However, I recently felt like it could be a valuable resource to learn about algorithms and visualize them and de-mystify them. I hope you enjoy
the final project, whenever it's finally finished lol.
